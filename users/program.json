Cloud Operation Engineer Responsibility usually operates in an office environment and is employed by technology services and software businesses. Cloud Operation Engineer may collaborate with departments such as application development and risk management to help with the early stages of development.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Additionally, Cloud Operation Engineer Responsibility may involve developing and implementing disaster recovery solutions, as well as helping with continuous improvement efforts. These experts may supervise system monitoring solutions and provide technical support to field workers.&nbsp;Chief CloudOps Engineer may develop methods for assessing the efficacy of their systems and identifying areas for improvement.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Cloud Operation Engineer's Responsibility is to develop procedures to ensure the security of the environment, as well as automated processes to give information on current requirements. Cloud Operations Engineers should remain current on emerging technologies and provide suggestions to organizational management about new solutions.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>CloudOps Engineer tasks include being in charge of tool selection, as well as compliance checks and reporting. Cloud Operation Engineer will be in charge of discovering, fixing, and improving critical software tools. Additionally, Chief CloudOps Engineer may look for methods to improve system operations, with an emphasis on automation and cost reduction.&nbsp;</p><p>Cloud operations (CloudOps) is the process of managing, delivering, and consuming software in a computer environment with limited visibility into the underlying infrastructure of an application.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>CloudOps in the enterprise leverages DevOps principles of continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) to establish best practices for ensuring high availability via the refinement and optimization of business processes running in a public cloud.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Typically, a CloudOps team's duties include the following:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Configuration&nbsp;</li><li>Administration</li><li>Allotment of resources</li><li>maximizing capacity for performance</li><li>minimizing compliance costs, and guaranteeing compliance with service-level agreements (SLAs).&nbsp;</li></ul><p><br></p><p>Cloud Operation Engineers begin their careers in the automotive industry, working for companies such as GM, Ford, Toyota, Chrysler, and others. Additionally, CloudOps Engineer job placement and Careers in Google, Facebook, Amazon, and Yandex are available in addition to the theoretical and practical work training. Microsoft, Wikipedia, and Yahoo are just a few examples.</p><p><br></p><h1>Training and Transformation for CloudOps Engineer</h1><p>Companies are increasingly relying on CloudOps Engineers to evaluate their infrastructure and migrate various operations to a cloud-based system, as more and more important business processes and applications are being moved to public, private, and hybrid cloud infrastructures.&nbsp;</p><p>A combination of technical abilities and business expertise is required for this position. Cloud Operation Engineer must have worked with at least one of the major cloud providers, including Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform.&nbsp;</p><p>The IT infrastructure is always evolving. The first computers, which took up a whole room, were controlled by technicians in the early days of computing. Over time, specialized equipment began to occupy the racks of data centers, which were then arranged in long rows on elevated floors. There is less interest in the underlying hardware and more emphasis is given to the overlying software capabilities when it comes to cloud computing technology.&nbsp;</p><p>Given the increasing need for cloud computing talents in today's market, it is beneficial to understand the specific skills required of a Cloud Engineer Jobs</p><ul><li>Linux- Although the cloud is a collection of virtualized, software-defined IT services that have been separated from their underlying hardware, it still needs an operating system to operate properly and efficiently. And Linux is the operating system of choice for the majority of users.</li><li>Programming- Cloud Operation Engineers that operate in the cloud computing environment have a variety of responsibilities. Cloud Operation Engineer Responsibilities in the fields of development, systems support, networking, security, and design. The ability to create scripts and deal with code is particularly important for developers, but there are many possibilities for cloud engineers of all colors to write scripts and deal with code.</li><li>Database Management- Databases, like so many other IT functional areas, are quickly migrating to the cloud. Unlike conventional databases, which are housed in data centers and maintained in discrete geographic areas, cloud databases may be distributed across a cloud architecture. Database-as-a-Service (DBaaS) is a kind of cloud database service provided by cloud providers for the purpose of storing and managing client data. As a cloud engineer, Chief CloudOps Engineer needs database abilities that extend beyond those required in the data center. NetApp discusses the typical database issues in the cloud in an essay. These include storage capacity constraints, database cloning, and multi-load operations. Although SQL is the primary database language for cloud computing, NoSQL is gaining popularity as a viable alternative to SQL's strict structure.</li><li>Multi-Cloud Deployment- Managing and deploying a single cloud is tough enough but managing a multi-cloud system may be much more complicated. The trick is to figure out how to integrate all the different cloud services into a single management system. In an ideal world, a Cloud Operation Engineer would have a single pane of glass for centralized management of the organization's public and private clouds.</li><li>Artificial Intelligence &amp; Machine learning- A significant portion of the cloud is being developed using self-contained apps. For example, chatbots and virtual assistants rapidly analyze and understand user input in order to react to queries and requests. Business intelligence and intelligent IoT devices are only two components of the complex web of networks that cloud developers must manage. Any Cloud Operation Engineer interested in working on the cloud will need to have a basic understanding of artificial intelligence and associated technologies. Cognitive computing is enabled by machine learning algorithms, which allow it to generate insights from massive amounts of data. While managing the cloud does not need a data scientist, it never hurts to brush up on your knowledge of AI and machine learning.</li><li>Automation- The information technology sector is constantly churning new buzzwords whose meanings may stay obscure for many years. Cloud automation is one of them. Automation is all about control and decision-making led by Chief CloudOps Engineer. CloudOps Engineer Jobs is to automate a computer process by allowing one piece of software to choose the next action in response to another. Cloud orchestration is similar to cloud automation, except that it automates many activities rather than a single one. Orchestration orchestrates the way cloud components accomplish tasks by coordinating activities and ensuring that everything works in unison – similar to an orchestra. Today's cloud infrastructures are heavily automated.</li><li>Cloud Security- Clearly, any information technology system that is linked to the internet needs strong security. Because the dangerous surface is so large, the cloud is especially susceptible to assault. Datacenter security may be maintained by enforcing firewalls and intrusion detection systems on external connections. However, maintaining security in today's dispersed computer environment, dubbed the cloud, is much more challenging.</li><li>Adaptability- Of course, this is not a specific talent reserved for Chief Cloud Ops Engineer. However, it is arguably the most critical talent that everyone should possess. It is critical to acquire knowledge of networking protocols, operating systems, web technologies, and cloud computing platforms. However, none of the skills you've acquired via books, videos, or classroom training will assist you if you lack the ability to think on your feet. The Cloud Operation Engineer's Responsibilities include constant adaptation to new technologies and, at times, creating solutions on the fly.

","description":"<h3><strong>What is a Full Stack Developer?</strong></h3><p><strong>Full Stack Developer</strong>&nbsp;is an engineer who works on both the client-side and server-side of the software application. This type of developer works on the Full Stack of a software application meaning Front end development, Back end development, Database, Server, API, and version controlling systems. Hence, the name “Full Stack” Developer.</p><p>Full-stack developer translates user requirements into the overall architecture and implements the new systems.&nbsp;<strong>A Full-Stack Developer doesn’t necessarily master all technologies.</strong>&nbsp;However, the professional is expected to work on the client as well as server sides and understand what is going on when developing an application. He or she should have a genuine interest in all software technologies.</p><p><br></p><h3><strong>Why Do You Need a Full-Stack Developer?</strong></h3><p>Here are some prominent reasons why you should hire a full-stack development professional:</p><ul><li>A full-stack developer helps you to keep every part of the system running smoothly</li><li>Full-stack developers can provide help to everyone in the team and greatly reduce the time and technical costs of team communication</li><li>If one person plays different roles, it saves your company’s personnel, infrastructure, and operational cost</li></ul><p><br></p><h2><strong>MERN Stack</strong></h2><p>MERN is a collection of JavaScript-based technologies:</p><ul><li>M=MongoDB: Popular&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.guru99.com/nosql-tutorial.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: var(--global-palette-highlight);\">NoSQL</a>&nbsp;database</li><li>E=Express: Light and portable web program framework</li><li>R=React: A javascript library for building user interfaces</li><li>N=Node.js: A server-side JavaScript run time</li></ul><p>This stack is currently in huge demand as it is widely used to develop web applications.</p><p><br></p><h2><strong>What is a Software Stack? Which Stack Should I Learn?</strong></h2><p>A software stack is a collection of the programs which are used together to produce a specific result. It includes an operating system and its application. For example, a smartphone software stack includes OS along with the phone app, web browsers, and default applications.</p><p>The above list of skill sets for a full-stack engineer could be daunting. You need to master a software stack based on your career goals, project, and company requirement. Following is a list of popular software stacks.</p><p>Irrespective of the stack you choose, you will find similarities in the architecture and design patterns across different stacks.</p><p><br></p><p>Full Stack Developer Skill Set</p><p><strong>1) Front-end technology</strong></p><p>Full-stack developers should be masters of essential front-end technologies like HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript. Knowledge of third-party libraries like <a href=\"https://www.guru99.com/reactjs-tutorial.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: var(--global-palette-highlight);\">ReactJS</a>&nbsp;is desirable and prepared in the program</p><p><strong>2) Development Languages</strong></p><p>The full-stack engineers should know at least one server-side programming language like Java, Python, Ruby, .Net, etc. JavaScript is the main program language for this program based on the MERN stack.</p><p><strong>3) Database and cache</strong></p><p>Knowledge of various DBMS technology is another important need of a full-stack developer. MySQL, MongoDB, Oracle, and SQLServer are widely used for this purpose. Knowledge of caching mechanisms like varnish, Memcached, and Redis is a plus. MongoDB is the part of the stack throughout the program.</p><p><strong>4) Basic design ability</strong></p><p>In order to become a successful Full-Stack web developer, knowledge of designing is also recommended. Moreover, the person should know the principle of basic prototype design and UI /UX design.</p><p><strong>5) Server</strong></p><p>Exposure to handling Apache or Nginx servers is desirable. A good background in Linux helps tremendously in administering servers.</p><p><strong>6) Version control system (VCS)</strong></p><p>A version control system allows full-stack developers to keep track of all the changes made in the codebase. The knowledge of&nbsp;<strong>Git</strong>&nbsp;helps full stack developers to understand how to get the latest code, update parts of the code, and make changes in other developers’ code without breaking things.</p><p><strong>7) Working with API (REST &amp; SOAP):</strong></p><p>Knowledge of web services or APIs is also important for full-stack developers. Knowledge of the creation and consumption of REST and SOAP services is desirable.</p><p><strong>Other Pieces of the Puzzle:</strong></p><ol><li>Ability to write quality&nbsp;<strong>unit tests</strong></li><li>He or she should have a complete understanding of automated processes for building testing, documenting, and deploying it at scale</li><li>An awareness of&nbsp;<strong>security</strong>&nbsp;concerns is important, as each layer has its own vulnerabilities</li><li>Knowledge of&nbsp;<strong>Algorithms</strong>&nbsp;and data structures is also an essential need for professional full-stack developers</li></ol><p><br></p><h2><br></h2>","shortDescription":"","isDemo":false,"content":null,"type":"program","isPublished":true,"isFeatured":false,"_id":"623deea139badaa8c430b6c3","title":"MERN Full-Stack Software Engineer","slug":"mern-full-stack-software-engineer","category":"623de82e39badaa8c430b5cc","subCategory":null,"instructor":{"_id":"61113691c4ea52404a295b05","name":"Shahed Mehebub"},"whatLearns":[],"createdAt":"2022-03-25T16:32:33.538Z","updatedAt":"2023-01-11T05:52:00.936Z","__v":0,"benefits":[{"_id":"629508a79f973aad1635c367","title":"Learn and Implement Agile Scrum","description":"Learn and become a MERN SE to follow the Agile Scrum framework","icon":"FaDev"},{"_id":"6295096a9f973aad1635c368","title":"Debugging the Codes","description":"Enhance, troubleshoot, bug fix, and collaborate with other devs to integrate other services","icon":"FaDev"},{"_id":"629509789f973aad1635c369","title":"Provide Presentation and Mentoring","description":"Provide presentation and mentoring.","icon":"FaDev"},{"_id":"629509839f973aad1635c36a","title":"Pass Weekly and Quarterly Technical Tests and Tasks","description":"After every workshop, we provide technical tests and tasks for you to complete.

From a Famous Site:</p><ol><li>A Python Developer is responsible for the coding, designing, deploying, and debugging of development projects, typically on the server-side (or back-end). They may, however, also help organizations with their technological framework.</li><li>A Python Developer’s role can span a wide variety of duties. You might be asked to create an application for your employer, design the framework for your code, build tools as necessary to get the job done, create websites, or publish new services. A Python Developer often works in close collaboration with data collection and analytics to create useful answers to questions and provide valuable insight.</li><li>Like most programming positions, the specifics of this job vary based on the needs of your employer. Some Python Developers work as independent contractors instead of being exclusive to one company.</li><li>Python is being used in web development, machine learning, AI, scientific computing, and academic research. Its popularity can be credited with the growing data science community embracing artificial intelligence and machine learning. Industries like education, healthcare, and finance are using machine-learning applications to innovate their organizations.</li><li>Python is also widely used by companies including Netflix, Google, Facebook, Reddit, YouTube, Instagram, and more. Specifically, Spotify uses Python within its back-end services, capturing user data to provide accurate recommendations and playlists. Dropbox, meanwhile, uses Python scripts to create its native applications on each platform (Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, Android, etc.)</li><li>A Python Developer will likely also be responsible for creating integrable systems, but ultimately, the role depends on the industry and job description.</li></ol>","shortDescription":"<p>Job-ready, interview, mock interview, professional job services, and guarantee to assist you to land in the job as one of the most high-demandable positions in the world of IT.&nbsp;</p>","isDemo":false,"content":null,"type":"program","isPublished":true,"isFeatured":false,"_id":"623df22039badaa8c430b809","title":"Python Software Engineer","slug":"python-software-engineer","category":"623df23639badaa8c430b8e2","subCategory":null,"instructor":{"_id":"61113691c4ea52404a295b05","name":"Shahed Mehebub"},"whatLearns":[],"createdAt":"2022-03-25T16:47:28.401Z","updatedAt":"2023-01-11T05:49:17.496Z","__v":0,"benefits":[{"_id":"629504d49f973aad1635c359","title":"Learn and Implement Agile Scrum","description":"Learn and become a Python SE to follow the Agile Scrum framework","icon":"FaDev"},{"_id":"629504e49f973aad1635c35a","title":"Microservices in Multiple Instances","description":"Learn how to run microservices in multiple instances","icon":"FaDev"},{"_id":"629504f39f973aad1635c35b","title":"Microservices Communicate","description":"Learn how Microservices communicate with each other","icon":"FaDev"},{"_id":"6295050c9f973aad1635c35d","title":"Develop Full Stack e-commerce Platform ","description":"Develop frontend, backend, APIs and connect with database.

","description":"<h3><strong>What is a Frontend Developer?</strong></h3><p><strong>Full Stack Developer</strong>&nbsp;is an engineer who works on both the client-side and server-side of the software application. This type of developer works on the Full Stack of a software application meaning Front end development, Back end development, Database, Server, API, and version controlling systems. Hence, the name “Full Stack” Developer.</p><p>Full-stack developer translates user requirements into the overall architecture and implements the new systems.&nbsp;<strong>A Full-Stack Developer doesn’t necessarily master all technologies.</strong>&nbsp;However, the professional is expected to work on the client as well as server sides and understand what is going on when developing an application. He or she should have a genuine interest in all software technologies.</p><p><br></p><h3><strong>Why Do You Need a Full-Stack Developer?</strong></h3><p>Here are some prominent reasons why you should hire a full-stack development professional:</p><ul><li>A full-stack developer helps you to keep every part of the system running smoothly</li><li>Full-stack developers can provide help to everyone in the team and greatly reduce the time and technical costs of team communication</li><li>If one person plays different roles, it saves your company’s personnel, infrastructure, and operational cost</li></ul><p><br></p><h2><strong>MERN Stack</strong></h2><p>MERN is a collection of JavaScript-based technologies:</p><ul><li>M=MongoDB: Popular&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.guru99.com/nosql-tutorial.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: var(--global-palette-highlight);\">NoSQL</a>&nbsp;database</li><li>E=Express: Light and portable web program framework</li><li>R=React: A javascript library for building user interfaces</li><li>N=Node.js: A server-side JavaScript run time</li></ul><p>This stack is currently in huge demand as it is widely used to develop web applications.</p><p><br></p><h2><strong>What is a Software Stack? Which Stack Should I Learn?</strong></h2><p>A software stack is a collection of the programs which are used together to produce a specific result. It includes an operating system and its application. For example, a smartphone software stack includes OS along with the phone app, web browsers, and default applications.</p><p>The above list of skill sets for a full-stack engineer could be daunting. You need to master a software stack based on your career goals, project, and company requirement. Following is a list of popular software stacks.</p><p>Irrespective of the stack you choose, you will find similarities in the architecture and design patterns across different stacks.</p><p><br></p><p>Full Stack Developer Skill Set</p><p><strong>1) Front-end technology</strong></p><p>Full-stack developers should be masters of essential front-end technologies like HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript. Knowledge of third-party libraries like <a href=\"https://www.guru99.com/reactjs-tutorial.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: var(--global-palette-highlight);\">ReactJS</a>&nbsp;is desirable and prepared in the program</p><p><strong>2) Development Languages</strong></p><p>The full-stack engineers should know at least one server-side programming language like Java, Python, Ruby, .Net, etc. JavaScript is the main program language for this program based on the MERN stack.</p><p><strong>3) Database and cache</strong></p><p>Knowledge of various DBMS technology is another important need of a full-stack developer. MySQL, MongoDB, Oracle, and SQLServer are widely used for this purpose. Knowledge of caching mechanisms like varnish, Memcached, and Redis is a plus. MongoDB is part of the stack throughout the program.</p><p><strong>4) Basic design ability</strong></p><p>In order to become a successful Full-Stack web developer, knowledge of designing is also recommended. Moreover, the person should know the principle of basic prototype design and UI /UX design.</p><p><strong>5) Server</strong></p><p>Exposure to handling Apache or Nginx servers is desirable. A good background in Linux helps tremendously in administering servers.</p><p><strong>6) Version control system (VCS)</strong></p><p>A version control system allows full-stack developers to keep track of all the changes made in the codebase. The knowledge of&nbsp;<strong>Git</strong>&nbsp;helps full stack developers to understand how to get the latest code, update parts of the code, and make changes in other developers’ code without breaking things.</p><p><strong>7) Working with API (REST &amp; SOAP):</strong></p><p>Knowledge of web services or APIs is also important for full-stack developers. Knowledge of the creation and consumption of REST and SOAP services is desirable.</p><p><strong>Other Pieces of the Puzzle:</strong></p><ol><li>Ability to write quality&nbsp;<strong>unit tests</strong></li><li>He or she should have a complete understanding of automated processes for building, testing, documenting, and deploying it at scale.</li><li>An awareness of&nbsp;<strong>security</strong>&nbsp;concerns is important, as each layer has its own vulnerabilities.</li><li>Knowledge of&nbsp;<strong>Algorithms</strong>&nbsp;and data structures is also an essential need for professional full-stack developers.</li></ol><p><br></p><h2><br></h2>","shortDescription":"","isDemo":false,"content":null,"type":"program","isPublished":true,"isFeatured":false,"_id":"633dd740e71dbb6ebd0d82e8","title":"FrontEnd Web Developer (Java Script)","slug":"frontend-web-develpr-(java-scripts)","category":"623de82e39badaa8c430b5cc","subCategory":null,"instructor":{"_id":"61113640c4ea52404a295b04","name":"Ahsanuzzaman"},"whatLearns":[],"createdAt":"2022-10-05T19:13:04.645Z","updatedAt":"2022-11-20T02:05:48.355Z","__v":0,"benefits":[{"_id":"629508a79f973aad1635c367","title":"Learn and Implement Agile Scrum","description":"Learn and become a MERN SE to follow the Agile Scrum framework","icon":"FaDev"},{"_id":"6295096a9f973aad1635c368","title":"Debugging the Codes","description":"Enhance, troubleshoot, bug fix, and collaborate with other devs to integrate other services","icon":"FaDev"},{"_id":"629509789f973aad1635c369","title":"Provide Presentation and Mentoring","description":"Provide presentation and mentoring.","icon":"FaDev"},{"_id":"629509839f973aad1635c36a","title":"Pass Weekly and Quarterly Technical Tests and Tasks","description":"After every workshop, we provide technical tests and tasks for you to complete.
